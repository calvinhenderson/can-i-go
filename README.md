# Can I Go?

An app for managing an open/closed schedule.


## Why?

Our Technology Help Desk consistently deals with odd hours and schedules. It is
inconvenient for end-users to not know if the Help Desk is open ahead of time.

This project was created to combat this issue by providing relevant schedule
information to end-users in real-time.


## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/calvinhenderson/can-i-go`
2. To run the project, execute `make run`
3. To run the project with live reloading, execute `make run/live`
